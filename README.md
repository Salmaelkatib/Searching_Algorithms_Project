# Searching_Algorithm_Project
 This program offers a user interface to allow the user to enter a Graph and 
choose the starting node and the set of goals/ goal that he wishes to reach , the
algorithm to be used, all the information required for the chosen algorithm then 
program operates in order to find the goal for the user , by printing out the path 
and all the visited nodes throughout the search operation .
Included search algorithms:
